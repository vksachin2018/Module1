# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

## 💻 Program
```
a = (1 == True)
b = (1 == False)
c = True + 3
d = False + 7

print("a is", a)
print("b is", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)

```

## Result
Therefore the Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False` has been successfully implemented.
